# Petfinder's.my Pawpularity Contest on Kaggle

A picture is worth a thousand words. With machine learning, we can  determine what makes a good photo to increase adoption rates and help animals in shelters find a loving home much quicker.

This project uses raw images and metadata from Kaggle to predict the "Pawpularity" of pet photos. This model was trained and tested using PetFinder.my's thousands of pet profiles.

### How Pawpularity Score Is Derived
The Pawpularity Score is derived from each pet profile's page view statistics at the listing pages, using an algorithm that normalizes the traffic data across different pages, platforms (web & mobile) and various metrics.
Duplicate clicks, crawler bot accesses and sponsored profiles are excluded from the analysis.
